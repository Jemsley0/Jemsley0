# Hi there! I'm Joseph

At work, I focus on making custom data solutions for my clients that range from setting up Data Warehouses, Statistical Modeling, and Job Shop Scheduling Optimizers... here I do whatever strange thing sounds fun.


* I use daily: `.py`, `.sql`
* I use occasionally: `.R`, `.pbix`
